# Quantum mechanics ...but why?!
## Epizode 1: Superposition

You've probably heard many things about quantum mechanics:
  * that quantum objects can seemingly exist in several mutually exclusive states at once
  * that quantum particles sometimes behave like waves
  * that quantum states are unit vectors and quantum observables are hermitian matrices
  * that measuring a quantum system disturbs it in some fundamental way, and that some quantities cannot be known at the same time
  * that quantum particles can sometimes act spookily at a distance
  * that there are some ethically dubious experiments with cats going on

Upon hearing these factoids you also probably paused and wondered: …but why?!

## Intro
(Intro animation)

Welcome to Dirac Piglets' original series “Quantum Mechanics …but why?!” This series of lectures is intended both for layfolk who've had enough of pop-sci trivia and want to *really* learn what quantum mechanics is about, as well as for physics students who may have already taken a Quantum Mechanics course but still feel like they're missing some key insights to really understand the theory.

In the lectures we will not shy away from complicated math, but we will always tie the equations to the bigger picture, so that even if you get a little lost in the notation, you should at least get some nice physical intuition from it. Where necessary, we will also create companion videos explaining the mathematical and physical prerequisites which we use in the main videos.

This series is going to take some time to make, so if you don't want to miss any future video, be sure to subscribe to our channel, or give us a follow on GitHub!

## The Structure of Atoms

...

The more skeptical amongst you might object to this conclusion, saying that this would prove nothing, as it all relies on my (clearly incomplete) model of the atom. Well, first of all: too many questions spoil the broth, and curiosity killed the cat¹. But yeah, I guess you're right Dr. Smarty-Pants. If you're so smart and critical, you can imagine we're shooting single neutrons instead, so rather than demonstrating the magnetic moment of an electron, you'd be measuring the magnetic moment of a neutron. Neutron is approximately a thousand times weaker as a magnet, so you'd need a more sensitive aparatus, but apart from that, the experiment would go exactly the same. Everyone happy? Good, we can carry on with the experiment.

¹ Technically, the cat is still alive at the same time.
